# Counter-App
It is the counter app, made up of html, css and js/

If you give some number to in the input section of the app, and and click the start Button, it will start the count from 0- to that given number.
For the sake of simplicity, I have just allowed to enter the number from 1-9, because it will take less time to execute, if in future we need to count the number more than 9 then it can be done.
